A wide range of ideas for \nep \ has been considered both by UKAEA and \nep \ grantees,
as indicated by the titles in \Tab{tabtit}, and choices described in the DDF
will be found supported by by the minutes of meetings which form
part of many reports. To see what has been considered before, it is recommended that 
the access-controlled github repository~\cite{xpndocswebsite} be cloned to a
local directory and its subdirectories {\tt reports} and {\tt reports/ukaea\_reports}
be indexed using software such as DocFetcher~\cite{docfetcherwebsite} or Recoll~\cite{recollwebsite}.

%%%\section{Notes (TODO)}\label{sec:DJF_notes}
%%%Specific discharge from exptal data-base (at a specific time)
%%%implies have a files of pseudo discharges as well
%%%
%%%Initialise with particles - deduce when fluid etc.
%%%
%%%Need data-base of first wall geometry
%%%
%%%Code has inbuilt capability for simple mesh generation  - uniform Cartesians, Cylindricals, toroids
%%%and simple assignment to faces
%%%
%%%Don't want  to learn new DSL.
%%%Special \LaTeX \ for generating equations
%%%Take output from computer algebra system/get system to output special \LaTeX
%%%
%%%Field variables - descriptions - suitable for generating modules, even simple menus as in ITER work

%%%\section{Verification and Validation (VV) Plan and Report}
%%%Template given in this section
%%%
%%%\subsection{Ideas for tests}
%%%\begin{itemize}
%%%\item  system level tests, ie integrated tests
%%%\item  MMS, possibly iPoPe of Cartier-Michaud et al
%%%\item  interval arithmetic
%%%\item  Convergence studies
%%%\item  Benchmarking with other programs
%%%\item  Nonfunctional requirements - performance, portability, accuracy
%%%\end{itemize}
%%%
%%%Plan should describe how unit test cases will be selected. Code coverage metrics. Mutation testing, fault testing, if 
%%%appropriate.
%%%
%%%\subsection{Validation}
%%%Experimental results to replicate
%%% 
%%%% Smith  - V+V Plan+Report
%%%% Hewitt  - Application Design  - Testability
%%%% Hewitt  - Application Design  - Monitorability and metric
%%%
%%%Surveys available options for issues by review or research
%%%gives reasons for preferring (maximum of 2) choices.
%%%
%%%\begin{enumerate}
%%%\item Novel physics for spectral elements
%%%\begin{itemize}
%%%\item Strong anisotropy due to magnetic field
%%%\item Unusual outflow and other boundary conditions at engineered boundaries
%%%\item Large particle sources and sinks
%%%\item Additional (plasma) kinetic effects
%%%\end{itemize}
%%%\item High order accurate mesh generation
%%%\item Design of overall code, data structures and separation of concerns
%%%\item Kinetics/gyrokinetics and high-dimensional finite elements/particles for edge
%%%\item Uncertainty quantification, including error control and bifurcation tracking
%%%\item Construction of surrogates
%%%\item Preconditioners
%%%\item Radical new computational ideas 
%%%\end{enumerate}
