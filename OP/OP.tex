%Everyone hates writing documentation, it gets written badly, and therefore no-one uses it. 
%Therefore no-one funds doing it, and documentation is bad. %Smith
%As with other overheads in software development, expects that work required will reduce over
%time as it becomes standard practice but need to convince people to adopt it in the first place!

\subsection{Object Identification}\label{sec:objdisc}
Douglass~\cite[\S\,5]{douglass} has a description of object analysis which is well-suited
project \nep. His approach is to take the use cases, which for this purpose should
include the \papp s separately, and treat them carefully one after the other using
the strategies indicated in \Tab{objdisc}.
Each \papp\ should be carefully analysed and classes produced from the list of objects
before proceeding to the next.
