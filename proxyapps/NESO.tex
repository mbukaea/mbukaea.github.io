NESO is an implementation of a 1+1D solver for the Vlasov-Poisson problem in which the matter component is 
treated using particle-in-cell (PIC).  The electric field is taken to be purely electrostatic and is calculated by 
solving a 1D Poisson equation using a Fourier transform.This is a prototype for the particle problem to be treated by
 more advanced NEPTUNE proxyapps and also provides a demonstration for the use of multiple repositories and workflows
 for different code components.  

The code is implemented in SYCL (DPCPP and hipSYCL).

NESO is publicly available at {https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/NESO}.
