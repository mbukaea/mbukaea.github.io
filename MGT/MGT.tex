Note that the report~\cite{y2d34} entitled ``Development Plan" is primarily
concerned with the documents needed for managing the project, and how
they should be arranged as a website.

The range of levels of detail and implicitly computational cost (from Exascale 
down to laptop) will follow from the projected development via a sequence of 
\papp s of increasing complexity and detail. This process is expected to 
enable an enhanced selection through experience and feedback, of
\begin{itemize}
\item a common set of software objects/classes
\item computer languages suitable for design with 'separation of concerns
\item numerical algorithms
\item user interfaces
\item interfaces to databases and coupling to codes not conforming to \nep \ standards
\end{itemize}
Selections will be recognised as better if they lead to improvements in 
scalability and portability, reliability and resilience, extensibility, and 
ease-of-use.
