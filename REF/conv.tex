When discussing software in the text, the following conventions in \LaTeX\  are proposed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \F{Small capitals} denote a package name, use \{\verb-\-textsc or abbreviation \verb-\-F\{
\item \I{Italics} denote a program name, use \{\verb-\-textit or abbreviation \verb-\-I\{
\item \T{Fixed width font} denotes any code name or fragment which is not otherwise obviously source code,
use \{\verb-\-texttt or abbreviation \verb-\-T\{
\end{itemize}
There is no need for special fonts if the object is identified by a
suitable suffix, thus ``\_m" for a module containing executable code,
``\_h" or ``.h" for an object description or namespace code, ``.cpp" for name of file containing
C++ source, ``.exe" for an executable, etc. Similarly file suffices that imply a particular
format or software for their interpretation, may simply be written with a leading stop,
eg.\ ``.html" and ``.exe".

In order to ensure smooth transliteration from mathematical symbols to the names
of the software variables, \Tab{twoclatex} lists the recommended two-character
equivalents for \LaTeX \ symbols used in the definition of mathematical symbols.
